It contains an instrument named Large Area Telescope (LAT), which performs an all-sky survey in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV.\nFermi LAT has the latest 14-year Source Catalog (4FGL-DR4), which contains more than 7000 gamma-ray sources. To visualise their temporal light curves, you can visit LightCurveRepository.\nI will guide you through the installation and analysis of Fermi LAT in the next sections.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/astro-notes/docs/phymj66-space-physics/","title":"Space Physics (PHYMJ66)","section":"Docs","content":" PHYMJ66: Space Physics # This course was introduced by BHU in 2024 in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 framework for the BSc Physics major students.

It deals with the position of astronomical objects in the sky. There are numerous objects in the sky, so we need to know how to locate them and conduct our study on them. The fundamental principle of every telescope (space-based or ground-based) lies in determining the position of an individual object.\nLatest deepsky image from Vera C Rubin Observatory of the Virgo Cluster\nYou can see there are so many objects detected with high precision in the above image. We need positional astronomy to determine them in the image.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/astro-notes/docs/fermi-lat-analysis/analysis/","title":"Analysis","section":"Fermi LAT Analysis","content":" Analysis # "},{"id":5,"href":"/astro-notes/docs/phymj66-space-physics/the-sun/","title":"The Sun","section":"Space Physics (PHYMJ66)","content":" PHYMJ66: The Sun # "},{"id":6,"href":"/astro-notes/docs/phymj66-space-physics/positional-astronomy/sec1/","title":"Astronomical Coordinate Systems","section":"Positional Astronomy","content":"Huh!!
