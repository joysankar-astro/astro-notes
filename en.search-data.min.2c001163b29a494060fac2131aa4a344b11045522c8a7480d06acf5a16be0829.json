It contains an instrument named Large Area Telescope (LAT), which performs an all-sky survey in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV.\nFermi LAT has the latest 14-year Source Catalog (4FGL-DR4), which contains more than 7000 gamma-ray sources. To visualise their temporal light curves, you can visit LightCurveRepository.\nI will guide you through the installation and analysis of Fermi LAT in the next sections.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/astro-notes/docs/fermi-lat-analysis/installation/","title":"Installation","section":"Fermi LAT Analysis","content":" Installation # Written byJoysankar Majumdar The Fermi mission provides a suite of tools called the Fermitools for the analysis of LAT. We are not going to use Fermitools directly; rather, we are going to use FermiPy.\nA Linux-based operating system is best for Fermi LAT analysis. We are going to follow the installation procedure for Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS.\nWe need to install the conda-forge distribution from the GitHub repository. From the latest release, download the Miniforge**-Linux-x86_64.sh file.\nRun this script file with the bash command.\nbash Miniforge3-25.3.1-0-Linux-x86_64.sh It will be installed in your system. Generally, it creates a folder miniforge in the home directory.\nYou need to export the path of the installed miniforge.\nexport PATH=path_to_the_diretory/miniforge/condabin:$PATH And now, in that same terminal, you need to initialise conda.\nconda init Now close this terminal and open another terminal, and it should look like below The (base) indicates the activation of the base environment in conda.\nWe have to create another environment for FermiPy. Run the command below in the terminal.\nmamba create --name fermipy -c conda-forge -c fermi python=3.9 \u0026#34;fermitools\u0026gt;=2.2.0\u0026#34; healpy gammapy After this, to activate the new fermipy environment, run\nmamba activate fermipy You have to install the fermipy package inside the fermipy environment\npip install fermipy Additionally, you should install the Jupyter Notebook for better coding\npip install notebook You have successfully installed fermitools and FermiPy. Make sure to use FermiPy; you need to activate the fermipy environment each time.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/astro-notes/docs/fermi-lat-analysis/analysis/","title":"Analysis","section":"Fermi LAT Analysis","content":" Analysis # I will be explaining how you can analyze the point sources detected by Fermi LAT.\nData download # Download the data for your specified source from the link.\nFor time conversion, you can use the xTime tool.\n"}]
