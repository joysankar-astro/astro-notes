# Astro-Notes


Hi, I am [Joysankar Majumdar](https://joysankar-astro.github.io/), and I am writing some helpful notes for BSc or MSc students.

Currently, I am writing notes about the **Space Physics** course (PHYMJ66), which is included in the new NEP BSc syllabus of Banaras Hindu University.

### Course progress
