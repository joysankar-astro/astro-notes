# Positional Astronomy

Positional astronomy is the fundamental concept in astronomy or astrophysics. It deals with the position of astronomical objects in the sky. There are numerous objects in the sky, so we need to know how to locate them and conduct our study on them. The fundamental principle of every telescope (space-based or ground-based) lies in determining the position of an individual object.

You can see there are so many objects detected with high precision in the above image. We need positional astronomy to determine them in the image.
