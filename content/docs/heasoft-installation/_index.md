# Fermi LAT Analysis
{{< badge style="info" title="Written by" value="Joysankar Majumdar" >}}

**HEASOFT (High Energy Astrophysics Software)** is a comprehensive software package developed by NASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC) for analyzing data from X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy missions. The suite includes tools for data reduction, spectral analysis, timing analysis, and image processing from missions like Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, NuSTAR, and many others. It provides both command-line utilities and interactive analysis environments, with core components like XSPEC for spectral fitting, XIMAGE for image analysis, and mission-specific tools for various high-energy observatories. HEASOFT is freely available and runs on Unix/Linux and macOS systems, making it an essential toolkit for researchers studying black holes, neutron stars, supernova remnants, and other high-energy astrophysical phenomena.

I will explain the installation in Linux.

### Download installation file
Download the source code from the [link](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/download.html). I recommend that you download the _Complete HEASoft source code (all mission & general-use software)_ from the page stated above.

Then extract it and put that extracted folder in a safe location where HEASOFT is to be installed.
