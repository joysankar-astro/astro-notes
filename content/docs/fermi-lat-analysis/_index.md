# Fermi LAT Analysis

The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, formerly GLAST, is opening this high-energy world to exploration and helping us answer these questions. It contains an instrument named Large Area Telescope (LAT), which performs an all-sky survey in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV.

Fermi LAT has the latest 14-year Source Catalog (4FGL-DR4), which contains more than 7000 gamma-ray sources. To visualise their temporal light curves, you can visit [LightCurveRepository](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/LightCurveRepository/).

I will guide you through the installation and analysis of Fermi LAT in the next sections.
